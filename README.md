# politik

Politik is a web3 framework for creating network states. A state is a collection of registries and values, like a JSON. Name, address, birth year and, blood type are all examples of registries a state keeps to conduct societal activity.

## But what is a 'network' state?

A network state is one which the borders are not geographically defined. The borders of the state consist in the amount of memetic bandwith it is consuming on the internet, hence the 'network' state. The state of the bandwith inside of the network is organized between parties. Members have free will and can behave in any game-theoretic way. What is not defined clearly out of the gate, are the rules and regulations for the network state. Members may only be granted 'citizenship' if they meet certain requirements.

The network state, can also have laws in which they use to operate, for example, every n years, the state's leader changes or, whenever a high ranking member initiates a proposal, member parties may respond to this proposal. The state can have it's own culture, it's own language, it's own members. All states are free to do whatever they choose as long as it aligns with the will of all members.

# Is a network state basically a DAO?

In essence yes, but many DAOs lack tooling to truly grow themselves into state-like structures.
